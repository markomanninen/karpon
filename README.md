Karpon
======

Karpon (meaning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpos fruit]) is a research tool for ancient scriptures 
based on letter number values of the alphabet of their writing system (script).

This method of searching hidden double meanings of the literary words is better known as *gematria* 
and *isopsephy*, which were and are practiced mostly by hebrew cabalists and greek gnostics.

With Karpon web application you can find occurences of the numerical values and corresponding words/phrases 
from the corpuses, examine their geometric connections between other terms and see number properties in table 
format.

Installing
==========

You can install application to your local computer or remote web server. Copy application's main folder
to your server public directory and reach it by web browser, for example: http://localhost/karpon/

You need to have PHP version 5.3 or higher, but there is no need for database, because data and logic 
used on appliation is all file and memory based.

You also need to have open internet connection to run everything smoothly, because some of the javascript 
is loaded from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network CDN].
